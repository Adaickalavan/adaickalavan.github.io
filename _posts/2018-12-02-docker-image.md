Below, I have listed several helpful Docker images which I maintain at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/adaickalavan/).

1. **Confluent-Kafka-Go**

   Automated docker build image for:

    + Alpine
    + Golang
    + Librdkafka
    + Confluent-Kafka-Go

    This docker image can be used as a build-stage image to build applications which depend on Golang and confluent-kafka-go.
