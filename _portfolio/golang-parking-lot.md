* Golang code - complete functioning sample code

The project structure is as follows:

├── vendor                    # folder containing dependant packages
│   ├── minheap               # dependant package `minheap`  
│   │   ├── item.go           # element of heap
│   │   └── priorityQueue.go  # min heap implementation
│   └── pretty                # dependant package `pretty`  
│       └── printer.go        # pretty prints array, slice, string
├── car.go                    # element of carpark
├── carpark.go                # carpark struct and pointer receiver methods
└── main.go                   # main file of Go code
