### Info
We will describe how to simulate step-by-step the wireless communication chain of a phase-shift keyed (PSK) modulated radio freqeuncy identification (RFID) system in Matlab. We will endeaour to provide the mathematical equations and corresponding Matlab code to model the transmitter, wireless channel (including transmitter and receiver antenna), and a digital baseband receiver of a RFID system. 

### Repository

The [repository](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/RFID) consists of the following:
