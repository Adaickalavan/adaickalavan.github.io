## Info
We will describe how to simulate step-by-step the wireless communication chain of a phase-shift keyed (PSK) modulated radio freqeuncy identification (RFID) system in Matlab. We will endeavour to provide the mathematical equations and corresponding Matlab code to model the transmitter, wireless channel (including transmitter and receiver antenna), and a digital baseband receiver of a RFID system. 

## Repository

The [repository](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/RFID-System-Simulation) consists of the following:  
* Matlab Codes for simulation of RFID system

{: .notice--success}
All equations, models, and algorithms in this repository were derived by hand, verified, and written in Matlab manually without using any off-the-shelf libraries.

## Model

{: .notice--warning}
More content and explanation will be added in this page as time permits.

### Antenna model & Wireless Channel
### Phase Lock Loop
### Digital Baseband Receiver
