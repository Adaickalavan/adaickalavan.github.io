## Info
We will describe how to simulate step-by-step the wireless communication chain of a phase-shift keyed (PSK) modulated radio freqeuncy identification (RFID) system in Matlab. We will endeavour to provide the mathematical equations and corresponding Matlab code to model the transmitter, wireless channel (including transmitter and receiver antenna), and a digital baseband receiver of a RFID system. 

## Repository

The [repository](https://github.com/Adaickalavan/RFID-System-Simulation) consists of the following:  
* Matlab Codes for simulation of RFID system

More content will be added as time permits. Feel free to send me an email about any enquiries that you might have on simulating RFID systems.

## Model
### Antenna model & Wireless Channel
### IQ Demodulator & Analog to Digital Converter
### Digital Baseband Receiver
