Welcome to my personal site. Here, I delve into the world of statistical signal processing, machine learning, blockchain, and pretty much about anything else which involves intelligence. In truth, machine learning spawned from the field of statistics and stochastic processes. Hence, a good grasp of the underlying mathematics and algorithms are necessary to excel in successfully automating intelligence to solve problems - a.k.a. machine learning!

Feel free to explore my site.

+ The <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> tab contains several of my works on statistical signal processing, distributed high performance, computing, machine learning, amd my doctoral endeavour.
+ The <a href="/year-archive/">posts</a> tab contain standalone posts on specific topics.
+ The <a href="/docs/guide/">guide</a> tab contains setup configurations and recommended coding standards, for various languages and tools.
