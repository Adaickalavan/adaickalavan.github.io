Adaickalavan received B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2010 and 2014, respectively. His Ph.D. was in Statistical Signal Processing and Adaptive Filter Theory, and was applied to the field of Optical Communication <a href="/portfolio/cwdaml_and_adaptivecwda/">receiver design</a>. His Ph.D. advisors were [Prof. Kam Pooi Yuen](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/pooi-yuen-kam/) and [Prof. Kim Hoon](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/node/12357).

From 2014 to 2017, he was a Software Engineer - Statistical Signal Processing, at NXP Semiconductors Singapore, where he (i) lead the Type-B NFC ASK/PSK digital baseband receiver design and (ii) was engaged in traffic sign recognition tasks for self-driving car application. Since 2017, he has been a Senior Software Engineer - Golang & C/C++, with Panasonic Singapore. Here, he worked on algorithm design, distributed high performance computing, and end-to-end system development for (i) classification of cognitive and behavioral distractions of a vehicle driver, and (ii) classification of facial expressions in the wild.

His expertise lies in engineering system software using Golang, C/C++ (OpenMP, OpenCL, OpenCV, MPI, CMake), Docker, and Python, primarily for applications in the fields of distributed high performance computing, computational modeling & simulation, digital signal processing, fiber-optic/wireless communication, video analytics, and machine learning. Strong in mathematical modeling, stochastic processes, optimization theory, algorithm development, and experimental skills.

Dr. Adaickalavan is a member of [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers - IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html). He is an ad-hoc reviewer for (i) [Optics Express - Optical Society of America](http://www.osa.org/en-us/home/), (ii) [Photonics Technology Letters - IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=68), and (iii) [Electronic Letters - IET](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/el).
