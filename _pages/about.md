Adaickalavan received B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2010 and 2014, respectively. His Ph.D. was in Statistical Signal Processing and Adaptive Filter Theory, and was applied to the field of Optical Communication <a href="/portfolio/cwdaml_and_adaptivecwda/">receiver design</a>. His Ph.D. advisors were [Prof. Kam Pooi Yuen](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/pooi-yuen-kam/) and [Prof. Kim Hoon](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/node/12357).

From 2014 to 2017, he was a Software Engineer - Digital Signal Processing, at NXP Semiconductors Singapore, where he lead the Type-B NFC ASK/PSK digital baseband receiver design. From 2017 to 2020, he was a Senior Software Engineer - C++ High Performance Computing, with Panasonic Singapore. Here, he worked on algorithm design, distributed high-performance computing, and end-to-end system development for (i) monitoring vehicle driver's cognitive and behavioral distractions, (ii) facial expression classification in the wild, and (iii) visual quality inspection of capacitors. From 2020, he is working at Huawei, Canada, on autonomous vehicle simulation and training (multi-agent reinforcement-learning) platform.

His expertise lies in engineering system software using C++ (OpenMP, MPI, gRPC, OpenCL, Boost, CMake, Linux), GPU, and Docker, primarily for applications in the fields of distributed high-performance computing, computational modeling & simulation, real-time digital signal processing, fiber-optic/wireless communication, reinforcement learning, and machine learning. Strong in mathematical modeling, stochastic processes, optimization theory, algorithm development, and experimental skills.

Dr. Adaickalavan is a member of [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers - IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html). He is an ad-hoc reviewer for (i) [Optics Express - Optical Society of America](http://www.osa.org/en-us/home/), (ii) [Photonics Technology Letters - IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=68), and (iii) [Electronic Letters - IET](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/el).
