<p>Welcome to my personal site. Here, I delve into the world of machine learning and statistical signal processing. In truth, machine learning spawned from the field of statistics and stochastic processes. Hence, a good grasp of the underlying mathematics and algorithms are necessary to excel in successfully automating intelligence to solve problems - a.k.a. machine learning!</p>

<p>Feel free to explore my site.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>The portfolio tab contains several of my works on statistical signal processing, machine learning, and my doctoral endeavour.</li>
  <li>The posts tab contain standalone posts on specific topics.</li> 
  <li>A quick self-learning guide for machine learning can be found in my post <a href="/guides/online-courses-in-machine-learning/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
